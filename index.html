<!-- 
Exercise 1: Change the script tag to point to puppies.js (instead of scripts.js) and observe the error in the Console. 
    It will give you links - something like http://127.0.0.1:5500/CodingExamples/Javascript-28-OCT/puppies.js and index.html:21...  
    Click on the links to get familiar with the tool. To get to the console, right click on Inspect in your browser and then click Console at the top of the DevTools menu.

Exercise 2: In scripts.js, uncomment the lines 'let if = 0' and 'console.log(if)' in scripts.js. Observe the error in the Console. 
    What is it saying and why is it giving an error? Rename the variable so that it doesn't throw this error.

Exercise 3: Uncomment the string literals in the scripts.js file and change the values of the variables

Exercise 4: Comment out the line in your <body> element that links the HTML to scripts.js. 
    Now put the code you had in your scripts.js file inside a <script> </script> tag in your HTML instead and make sure it still works. 

Exercise 5: Create a folder inside of this folder you cloned and call it Scripts. Move your scripts.js file into there, but leave the HTML file where it is. 
  Then change your script tag in the HTML so that it still points to the correct .js file! Google how to move up and down a level in relative paths if you get stuck.

Exercise 6: Initalize a variable and then print it in the console

Exercise 7: Now, set this variable to null and make sure it prints 'null' in the console

Exercise 8: Change the variable again so that it has a value of undefined. Print it in the console to make sure!
